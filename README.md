# Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for Laravel Eloquent

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two, and maybe throw in a mention of what
PSRs you support to avoid any confusion with users and contributors.

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require laravolt/eloquent-uuid
```

## Usage

``` php
$skeleton = new Laravolt\Skeleton();
echo $skeleton->echoPhrase('Hello, League!');
```
